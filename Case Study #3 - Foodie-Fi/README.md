## Questions and Solutions

### A. Customer Journey

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

```sql
SELECT 
	customer_id,
	plan_name, 
	start_date,
	start_date - LAG(start_date) OVER(
		PARTITION BY customer_id
		ORDER BY start_date 
    ) AS date_diff
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions 
INNER JOIN foodie_fi.plans USING(plan_id)
WHERE customer_id IN (1, 2, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19)
ORDER BY 1, 3;
```

**Output:**

| customer_id | plan_name     | start_date               | date_diff|
