## Questions and Solutions

### A. Customer Journey

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

```sql
SELECT 
	customer_id,
	plan_name, 
	start_date,
	start_date - LAG(start_date) OVER(
		PARTITION BY customer_id
		ORDER BY start_date 
    ) AS date_diff
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions 
INNER JOIN foodie_fi.plans USING(plan_id)
WHERE customer_id IN (1, 2, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19)
ORDER BY 1, 3;
```

**Output:**

| customer_id | plan_name     | start_date               | date_diff|
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| 1           | trial         | 2020-08-01T00:00:00.000Z |          |

#### 2. What is the monthly distribution of `trial` plan `start_date` values for our dataset 

*Use the start of the month as the group by value.*

```sql
SELECT

	COUNT(1) AS distribution
FROM subscriptions
INNER JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
WHERE plan_name = 'trial'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

#### 3. What plan `start_date` values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? 

*Show the breakdown by count of events for each `plan_name`.*

```sql

	COUNT(1) AS no_events
FROM subscriptions
INNER JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date) > 2020
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1;

```

**Output:**

| plan_id | plan_name     | no_events |
| ------- | ------------- | --------- |
| 1       | basic monthly | 8         |
| 2       | pro monthly   | 60        |
| 3       | pro annual    | 63        |

#### 4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?

```sql
SELECT
	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS churn_cnt,
	ROUND(
		100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) / (
			SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
			FROM subscriptions
	), 1) AS churn_pct
FROM subscriptions
INNER JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
WHERE plan_name = 'churn';
```

**Output:**

| churn_cnt | churn_pct |
| --------- | --------- |

#### 5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?

```sql
WITH prev_sub AS (
  SELECT 
      *,
      LAG(plan_name) OVER(
          PARTITION BY customer_id
          ORDER BY start_date
      ) AS prev_plan,
      start_date - LAG(start_date) OVER(
          PARTITION BY customer_id
          ORDER BY start_date
      ) AS date_diff
  FROM subscriptions
  INNER JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
)

SELECT
	COUNT(1) AS churn_cnt,
	ROUND(
		100.0 * COUNT(1) / (
			SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
			FROM subscriptions
	), 1) AS churn_pct_to_all_cus,
	ROUND(
		100.0 * COUNT(1) / (
			SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
			FROM subscriptions
			INNER JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
			WHERE plan_name = 'churn'
	), 1) AS churn_pct_to_all_churn
FROM prev_sub
WHERE plan_name = 'churn'
      AND prev_plan = 'trial'
      AND date_diff = 7;
```

**Output:**

| churn_cnt | churn_pct_to_all_cus | churn_pct_to_all_churn |
| --------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 92        | 9.2                  | 30.0                   |

#### 6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?

```sql
WITH prev_sub AS (
  SELECT 
      *,
      LAG(plan_name) OVER(
          PARTITION BY customer_id
          ORDER BY start_date
      ) AS prev_plan
  FROM subscriptions
  INNER JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
)

SELECT 
	plan_id,
	plan_name,
	COUNT(1) AS cus_plan_cnt,
	ROUND(
      COUNT(1) * 100.0 / (
          SELECT COUNT(1)
          FROM prev_sub
          WHERE prev_plan = 'trial'
     ), 1) AS cus_plan_pct
FROM prev_sub
WHERE prev_plan = 'trial'
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1;
```

**Output:**

| plan_id | plan_name     | cus_plan_cnt | cus_plan_pct |
