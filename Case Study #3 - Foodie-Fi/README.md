## Questions and Solutions

### A. Customer Journey

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

```sql
SELECT 
	customer_id,
	plan_name, 
	start_date,
	start_date - LAG(start_date) OVER(
		PARTITION BY customer_id
		ORDER BY start_date 
    ) AS date_diff
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions 
INNER JOIN foodie_fi.plans USING(plan_id)
WHERE customer_id IN (1, 2, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19)
ORDER BY 1, 3;
```

**Output:**

| customer_id | plan_name     | start_date               | date_diff|
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| 1           | trial         | 2020-08-01T00:00:00.000Z |          |

### B. Data Analysis Questions

#### 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS cus_cnt
FROM subscriptions;
```

**Output:**

| cus_cnt |
| ------- |
| 1000    |

The company has had 1000 customers.

#### 2. What is the monthly distribution of `trial` plan `start_date` values for our dataset 

*Use the start of the month as the group by value.*

```sql
SELECT
	DATE_TRUNC('month', start_date) AS start_month,

FROM subscriptions
INNER JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
WHERE plan_name = 'trial'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

	COUNT(1) AS no_events
FROM subscriptions
INNER JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date) > 2020
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1;

```

**Output:**

	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS churn_cnt,
	ROUND(
		100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) / (
			SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
			FROM subscriptions
	), 1) AS churn_pct
FROM subscriptions
INNER JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
WHERE plan_name = 'churn';
```

**Output:**

| churn_cnt | churn_pct |
| --------- | --------- |
| 307       | 30.7      |

There were 307 churned customers, and churn rate is 30.7%.

---

#### 5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?

```sql
WITH prev_sub AS (
  SELECT 
      *,
      LAG(plan_name) OVER(
          PARTITION BY customer_id
          ORDER BY start_date
      ) AS prev_plan,
      start_date - LAG(start_date) OVER(
          PARTITION BY customer_id
          ORDER BY start_date
      ) AS date_diff
  FROM subscriptions
  INNER JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
)

SELECT
	COUNT(1) AS churn_cnt,
	ROUND(
		100.0 * COUNT(1) / (
			SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
			FROM subscriptions
	), 1) AS churn_pct_to_all_cus,
	ROUND(
		100.0 * COUNT(1) / (
			SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
			FROM subscriptions
			INNER JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
			WHERE plan_name = 'churn'
	), 1) AS churn_pct_to_all_churn
FROM prev_sub
WHERE plan_name = 'churn'
      AND prev_plan = 'trial'
      AND date_diff = 7;
```

**Output:**

| churn_cnt | churn_pct_to_all_cus | churn_pct_to_all_churn |
| --------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 92        | 9.2                  | 30.0                   |

There were 92 customers churning immediately after their initial free trial. It presents approximately 9.2% of the number of customers and accounts for 30% of the number of churned customers.

---

#### 6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?

```sql
WITH prev_sub AS (
  SELECT 
      *,
      LAG(plan_name) OVER(
          PARTITION BY customer_id
          ORDER BY start_date
      ) AS prev_plan
  FROM subscriptions
  INNER JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
)

SELECT 
	plan_id,
	plan_name,
	COUNT(1) AS cus_plan_cnt,
	ROUND(
      COUNT(1) * 100.0 / (
          SELECT COUNT(1)
          FROM prev_sub
          WHERE prev_plan = 'trial'
     ), 1) AS cus_plan_pct
FROM prev_sub
WHERE prev_plan = 'trial'
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1;
```

**Output:**

| plan_id | plan_name     | cus_plan_cnt | cus_plan_pct |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1       | basic monthly | 546          | 54.6         |
| 2       | pro monthly   | 325          | 32.5         |
| 3       | pro annual    | 37           | 3.7          |
| 4       | churn         | 92           | 9.2          |

Over 90% of customers chose paid plan with a majority opting for the basic monthly and pro monthly plans, likely due to the cheaper pricing.

---

#### 7. What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 `plan_name` values at `2020-12-31`?

```sql
WITH cur_plan AS (
  SELECT 
      plan_id,
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
          PARTITION BY customer_id
          ORDER BY start_date DESC
      ) rn
  FROM subscriptions
  WHERE start_date <= MAKE_DATE(2020, 12, 31)
)

SELECT 
	plan_id,
	plan_name,
	COUNT(1) AS cus_cnt,
	ROUND(
		COUNT(1) * 100.0 / (
			SELECT COUNT(1)
			FROM cur_plan
			WHERE rn = 1
		), 1) AS cus_pct
FROM cur_plan
INNER JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
WHERE  rn = 1
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1;
```

**Output:**

| plan_id | plan_name     | cus_cnt | cus_pct |
| ------- | ------------- | ------- | ------- |
| 0       | trial         | 19      | 1.9     |
| 1       | basic monthly | 224     | 22.4    |
| 2       | pro monthly   | 326     | 32.6    |
| 3       | pro annual    | 195     | 19.5    |
| 4       | churn         | 236     | 23.6    |

```sql
SELECT 
	plan_id,
	plan_name,
	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS cus_cnt
FROM subscriptions
INNER JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date) = 2020
	AND plan_name LIKE '%annual%'
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1;
```

| ------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 3       | pro annual | 195     |

195 customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020.

---

#### 9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?

```sql
WITH annual_cus AS (
  SELECT 
      customer_id,
      start_date AS start_annual,
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
      	PARTITION BY customer_id
      	ORDER BY start_date
      ) AS rn
  FROM subscriptions
  INNER JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
  WHERE plan_name LIKE '%annual%'
)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(start_annual - start_date)) day_avg
FROM subscriptions s
INNER JOIN annual_cus a USING(customer_id)
INNER JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
WHERE rn = 1
	AND s.start_date <= a.start_annual
	AND plan_name = 'trial';
```

**Output:**

| day_avg |
| ------- |
| 105     |

It takes 105 days on average for a customer upgrade to an annual plan.

---

#### 10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods 

*(i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)*

**Steps:**
1. Identify customers who have been on an annual plan by the `annual_cus` CTE.
2. Join the subscriptions table with the CTE annual_cus and the plans table.
3. Keep only the first annual subscription record for each customer *(`rn = 1`)* and customers on the `trial` plan and where the trial subscription `start_date` is before or equal to the annual subscription start date.
4. Group the result by 30-day period and apply aggregate function.
5. Order the result based on the start of the 30-day period.

```sql
WITH annual_cus AS (
  SELECT 
      customer_id,
      start_date AS start_annual,
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
      	PARTITION BY customer_id
      	ORDER BY start_date
      ) AS rn
  FROM subscriptions
  INNER JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
  WHERE plan_name LIKE '%annual%'
)

SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT 
      CASE
          WHEN (start_annual - start_date)  <= 30 THEN '0-30 days'
          ELSE (((start_annual - start_date - 31) / 30 + 1)  * 30 + 1)::TEXT || '-' || (((start_annual - start_date - 31) / 30 + 1) * 30 + 30)::TEXT || ' days'
      END AS day_period,
      COUNT(1) AS cus_cnt,
      ROUND(AVG(start_annual - start_date)) AS day_avg
  FROM subscriptions s
  INNER JOIN annual_cus a USING(customer_id)
  INNER JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
  WHERE rn = 1
      AND s.start_date <= a.start_annual
      AND plan_name = 'trial'
  GROUP BY 1
) AS a
ORDER BY SPLIT_PART(day_period, '-', 1)::INT;
```

**Output:**

| day_period   | cus_cnt | day_avg |
| ------------ | ------- | ------- |
| 0-30 days    | 49      | 10      |
| 31-60 days   | 24      | 42      |
| 61-90 days   | 34      | 71      |
| 91-120 days  | 35      | 101     |
| 121-150 days | 42      | 133     |
| 151-180 days | 36      | 162     |
| 181-210 days | 26      | 191     |
| 211-240 days | 4       | 224     |
| 241-270 days | 5       | 257     |
| 271-300 days | 1       | 285     |
| 301-330 days | 1       | 327     |
| 331-360 days | 1       | 346     |

#### 11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?

```sql
-- Get customers who subscribed to the basic monthly plan in 2020
WITH cus_basic AS (
  SELECT 
      customer_id,
      start_date AS basic_date
  FROM subscriptions
  INNER JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
  WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date) = 2020
      AND plan_name = 'basic monthly'
)

SELECT COUNT(1) AS cus_cnt
FROM subscriptions s
INNER JOIN cus_basic c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id AND s.start_date < c.basic_date
INNER JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
WHERE plan_name = 'pro monthly';
```

**Output:**

| cus_cnt |
| ------- |
| 0       |

 There is no customer downgraded their plans from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020.
